# Third-party software in WheelConvert

WheelConvert is free. It bundles the open-source components below; their full license texts are in
`WheelConvert.app/Contents/Resources/Licenses` (and `Office/runtime/legal` for the Java runtime).

## Media (separate executables: `Tools/ffmpeg`, `Tools/ffprobe`)

| Component | Version | License |
|---|---|---|
| FFmpeg | 9.0.1 | LGPL 2.1 or later (built without `--enable-gpl` or `--enable-nonfree`) |
| LAME (MP3 encoder) | 3.100 | LGPL 2 or later |
| libvpx (VP8/VP9) | 1.17.0 | BSD 3-Clause |
| Opus | 1.6.1 | BSD 3-Clause |
| libogg / libvorbis | 1.3.6 / 1.3.7 | BSD 3-Clause |
| libwebp | 1.6.0 | BSD 3-Clause (also linked into the app for WebP encoding) |

FFmpeg and its codec libraries run as standalone programs that WheelConvert launches; they are not linked
into the app. The exact FFmpeg and LAME source archives used for each build are attached to its GitHub
release, and `scripts/build-ffmpeg.sh` rebuilds them with the recorded configure flags (`ffmpeg -version`
prints them). You may rebuild and replace `Tools/ffmpeg` and `Tools/ffprobe` with your own LGPL-compatible
builds.

## Metadata

| ExifTool by Phil Harvey | 13.59 | Same terms as Perl (Artistic License or GPL) |

ExifTool runs as an unmodified script on macOS's `/usr/bin/perl`.
